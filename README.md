# React DojoBlog

This is my first React walk-through project with Shaun, known as the NetNinja on YouTube. In this project I learn to build a simple blog single page application using React-js. User's that visit the site can create, read, update and delete blogs.

Below is a link for the project deployed to Heroku.

## Features

Here are a few descriptions of the features of this project.

- Reactive page loads, allows for faster page loads without the page refreshing using Reacts re-usable components.
- Form allowing using to upload any blog article they would like to.

More features soon to come such as authentication and may be graphic animations.

    - **JavaScript** is used to provide dynamic contents for the project.

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/default.asp)
    - The project uses **CSS** to create a visually pleasing UI.

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - **Firebase** realtime database is used for database management of the blog contents.


## Testing

- Code Validation   
    - In development mode, React runs and automatically checks for code errors and provides suggestions.

- Database Test
    - Sent a POST request using the front end form.
    - Confirmed the request was a success by viewing the associated Firbase database.
    - The above steps were repeated for reading, writing, and deleting requests.
